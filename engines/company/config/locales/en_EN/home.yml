            visible: Kobune-IVR is our Interactive Voice Response system. It helps you configure the behaviour of a phone call received by a telephone, taking into account the telephone that is making the call, or information selected through menus, data input and the time of the call.
            hidden:
              h1: 'Kobune-IVR is configured as diagrams associated to an incoming telephone number. When that caller is driven into the first node of the diagram, depending on the performance configured, several actions will occur, such as: check of the time, check of the incoming number, reproduction of audios, options menu to branch off the behaviour into different directions, data input to obtain information about the user, audio recording or transfer of the call to a different telephone.'
              h2: All this is configured from a simple and easy-to-use interface. You will always have a global vision of the running of your system and you will be able to change the behaviour of the calls in real time, at any moment, from anywhere.

            visible: Tsune-ACD is an Automatic Call Distributor. This system is conceived for centres where calls are answered by several agents, and where a control of the number of calls on hold and the status of the active and busy agents is needed, being configurable through a simple interface that is accessible from any device.
            hidden:
              h1: Tsune-ACD lets a supervisor to manage and monitor the agents of a call-centre. It even enables a company to do so with call-centres and agents geographically distributed. It makes it possible to know the number of calls on hold, how many calls are being answered, the statistics of each agent and, if the supervisor requires it, a listening-in of any current call.
              h2: The agent has a panel in which they are informed of the incoming call and in which they can start an event from the browser, such as opening a website with the data provided by the system. The agent can also configure their status in case they need to leave their post.
